# It's recommended to group all the resources/objects related to a microservice
# in a single YAML file (separated by --- in YAML).
#
# It's also recommended to declare service first and then deployment, so that
# the scheduler can spread the pods associated with the service as they're created
# by the controller(s), such as Deployment object.
